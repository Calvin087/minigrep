Beyoncé Giselle Knowles-Carter
(born September 4, 1981), better known professionally
by her first name Beyoncé, is an American singer, rapper,
songwriter, producer, and actress.

In the twenty-first century, no pop star was as poised,
as polished, or as generally fierce as Beyoncé. She scored
early success with Destiny’s Child, who started out as a
sexier and sassier (if less adult) version.
